\section{Results}
Presentation of two different subjects: enclosed gate (ECG)layout transistors and ISFETs
Even though there are different, the idea of this project is to include the possible benefit of the first technology (ECG) into ISFETs applications.

\section{Achievements}

\section{Publucation(s) arisong from this work}

\section{Future work}
In this part we are presenting a “special” transistor; how it works, the model and defects.

\subsection{CMOS ISFET model}
Standard ISFETs model: 30 years of ISFETOLOGY is the beginning

\subsection{ISFET defects}
Whereas the ISFETs is a wonderful tool it presents some defaults/defects and we need to define them to use this tool in an appropriate way (compensate his defects)

\section{The DNA sequencing, a typical ISFET application}
This section presents a well-known and interesting application for the ISFETs as a pH sensor: the DNA sequencing.
Yet, to understand it we need to do a brief explanation of DNA sequencing as the basics of genetic and how DNA is made/worked.
\newline
-    What is DNA?
\newline
-    Why do we use DNA sequencing?
\newline
-     How perform DNA sequencing? (PCR / Sanger sequencing)
\newline
-     What is CMOS microarray? (non-optical genome sequencing)
\newline
-    High-throughput sequencing? (sequencing by hybridization)

\section{Goals}
Resume the goals of this thesis: Use a new architecture inspired from the nature and others areas of application in pH sensing.
Insist on the fact that it is challenging and never done before in these two fields of researches.
