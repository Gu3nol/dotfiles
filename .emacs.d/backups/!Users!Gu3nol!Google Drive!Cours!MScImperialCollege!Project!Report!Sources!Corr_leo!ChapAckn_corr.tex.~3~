First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Pantelis Georgiou for his precious guidance throughout this project. His insightful support and constant motivation have enabled me to take this project from a vague idea to its current state. I am also very pleased for having been able to participate in the tape-out of July 2015. This was the first time that I produced a chip. Being involved in such process was a rewarding experience and was a great opportunity

I am also very grateful to the people who took part in the tape-out with me and gave me advice and support; Dora, Ermis, Nicholas and Nicolas. At the end there was a lot of pressure to get the chip done but we managed to do something great. A special thank to Nicolas for helping me when I was lost in my simulation and design. His friendship and motivation encouraged me to do my best.

A special mention to Wiesia Hsissen who was like a second mum with her kindness. She is always here to facilitate our work or to help us when we need something.

Most of all, I offer a warm thank to my parents for their continual encouragement. This year in London would not have been possible without their sacrifices and their support. This work is dedicated to you! %coeur coeur love :) %
