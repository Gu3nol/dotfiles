	Abstract = {The authors have designed a planar diffuse silicon diode on an n-channel pH-sensitive ISFET sensor to act as a temperature sensor for on-chip temperature measurement and compensation. Critical and accurate pH measurements require fast response to changing thermal conditions, and the on-chip diode provides a possible solution to fast detection of thermal fluctuations. Temperature compensation is achieved by signal processing electronics. The authors present experimental results on the use of this dual sensor for pH and temperature. Various parameters affecting the thermal characteristics of the overall temperature response of the pH-ISFET sensor are discussed. The improvements that provide more accurate pH measurements are presented.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the development of ISFETs in an historical setting, but is not limited to that. Based on the development regarding the theory, the technology, the instrumentation and the experience with many specific applications, also future projects are defined, such as concerning cell acidification, REFET biasing and a complete new range of FET sensors based on local pressure induction by (bio)chemical interaction with immobilised charged molecules (hydrogels). Also the present patent and market position is discussed. It is concluded that in the past 30 years the ISFET research and development made continuous progress on a regular base, but the practical applications stayed behind, especially concerning the dynamic use of ISFETs in combination with an integrated pH actuator. The newly proposed research projects may be good for an other 30 years.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET ) readout circuit including a novel nonlinear temperature compensation method that is based on the theoretical work for formulating a body-effect-based ISFET drain current expression, the derivation of an unified temperature-dependent ISFET threshold voltage expression, and the use of iterative method for solving design parameters in nonlinear equations. Regarding the basic readout circuit, it comprises only one source follower and one current source to establish a self-biased configuration for a single ISFET device. Due to elimination of body effect, it displays linear transfer characteristic in the experimental result. Incorporating temperature compensation further improves the thermal stability of the ISFET device in pH sensing function. This has been validated by the experimental results on pH values ranging from 4 to 9 in a temperature range of 22 C to 50 C from the measurement setup. The pH7 parameter is used as a reference in the method. The proposed works are attractive in terms of circuit simplicity, temperature-compensated performance, cost and compatibility for smart sensor operation.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new intelligent ISFET sensory system dedicated to a precision pH sensory function, as well as a long-term monitoring capability without being jeopardized by temperature and drift fluctuations in the water-quality monitoring environment. It includes the novel compensation technique for counteracting a simultaneous change of temperature and drift, the design of the sensory system incorporating hardware and software co-design for enhancing the performance stability of a standard ISFET device and a new programmable current source with reduced dynamic current error for a dedicated temperature compensation process. The proposed ISFET sensory system, with about a 0.01 pH resolution in system design at a 3.3 V supply, has been validated by the experiments, exhibiting a maximum accuracy error of 0.02 pH at 23C and 0.05 pH at 40C with dual compensation. The compensation results show a maximum time drift of 0.003 pH/hour (0.166 mV/hour) at 23C and an average temperature drift of 0.00049 pH/hour/C (0.0245 mV/hour/C) for a reference temperature increase from 23C to 40C, with the value of the pH solution ranging from 4 to 9 in six-hour measurements. These measured results outperform those of the reported drift reduction techniques, suggesting that the ISFET sensory system using novel compensation can provide significant immunity against temperature change, time drift, and temperature drift, which are favorable towards robust measurements in environmental monitoring applications. 2008 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The digital read-out scheme in an ion-sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) sensing array is more advantageous when compared with the analogue counterpart because of its lower power consumption, smaller area and less susceptibility to environmental noise and parasitics. An improved read-out scheme is proposed in which each ISFET is stacked with a CMOS inverter to form a pH-to-time converter. The pH level of the solution regulates the strength of the ISFET, which in turn modulates the delay of the stacked inverter and hence the pulse width of the output signal. Simulation results using the 0.18 m/2.5 V CMOS process show that the modulated pulse width changes linearly over a wide range of pH. The design achieves five orders of magnitude smaller leakage and 40% lower dynamic power consumption, while it requires only 50% of silicon area when compared with the conventional design. It is therefore more suitable for large ISFET arrays implemented in nano-scale CMOS technologies. The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.},

This instability, commonly known as drift, manifests itself as a relatively slow, monotonic change in the measuring output signal in the absence of variations in the pH. In this work, a method for correction of ISFET drift is presented. This method takes advantage of the relatively small instantaneous drift rate in ISFETs to compensate for the drift signal superimposed on the sensor output.

Jamasb et al., 1997) is further examined by considering the distinction between drift and low-frequency noise. A physical model for drift in pH-sensitive ISFETs has been employed to isolate the low frequency noise associated with these devices. Characterization of the low-frequency noise behavior of ISFET-based biosensors, is particularly relevant to the applicability of the proposed method which is based on monitoring the differential of the sensor output signal over sufficiently small intervals of time. The validity of the reported corrective scheme for continuous monitoring of pH is experimentally confirmed under conditions approximating acute metabolic acidosis using a Si3N4-gate pH-sensitive ISFET whose noise spectrum was characterized a priori. The theoretical and experimental results presented in this work have a direct bearing on ISFET-based biosensors which detect a local pH change using a pH-sensitive ISFET, such as ISFET glucose sensors.},

For each array pixel, a pair of complementary ISFETs shares the same floating gate in an inverter configuration. An additional electrical input is capacitively coupled to the same floating gate with a periodic reference signal input. In this way, the conventional ISFET analogue output is replaced by a chemically controlled pulse width modulated signal. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show a pulse width pH sensitivity of around 6%, of the input reference signal period, per pH. This is achieved along with %1%V offset suppressing capability.},

We describe how to design arrays of floating-gate ISFETs so that ultraviolet (UV) radiation and bulk-substrate biasing can be used to remove the random amount of trapped charge that accumulates on the gates during fabrication. The approach is applied directly to a prototype single-chip 2 2 array of ISFETs, which is designed and fabricated in a standard 0.35- CMOS process. By considering the transconductance characteristics of the 2 2 array before and after UV exposure, it is shown that the response can be matched after 10 h and that the ISFET threshold voltages converge to an equilibrium value of approximately 1 V. After matching, it is found that the ISFET array has a measured sensitivity of 46 mV/pH and can successfully image a change in the pH of a homogeneous electrolyte solution.},

All signal acquisition is performed in-situ and all readout circuitry is located on-chip. On return from the foundry, the devices are exposed to ultraviolet light to eliminate any difference in threshold voltage. The circuit provides a sufficient linear range that allows the FET devices to operate as pH sensors in the array. A double layer of SU-8 photoresist is used to provide both a biocompatible and waterproof package for the chip.

Two commercial CMOS process families, including 0.35, 0.18, 0.13, and 0.09 m m processing nodes, have been used to model ISFETs of different sizes and biasing conditions with simulation results indicating that the noise behavior of a ISFET deviates significantly from the underlying MOSFETs. In particular, a capacitive division effect is observed at the gate due to the passivation and parasitic capacitances, effectively attenuating any signal and noise. The dependence of the attenuation on gate parasitics means that smaller devices, which operate in the weak inversion region, cause the least attenuation, therefore, lowest input referred noise, a result that is contradictory to what is expected with MOSFETs.},

	Abstract = {Temporal noise sets the fundamental limit on image sensor performance, especially under low illumination and in video applications. In a CCD image sensor, temporal noise is primarily due to the photodetector shot noise and the output amplifier thermal and 1/f noise. CMOS image sensors suffer from higher noise than CCDs due to the additional pixel and column amplifier transistor thermal and 1/f noise. Noise analysis is further complicated by the time-varying circuit models, the fact that the reset transistor operates in subthreshold during reset, and the nonlinearity of the charge to voltage conversion, which is becoming more pronounced as CMOS technology scales. The paper presents a detailed and rigorous analysis of temporal noise due to thermal and shot noise sources in CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) that takes into consideration these complicating factors. Performing time-domain analysis, instead of the more traditional frequency-domain analysis, we find that the reset noise power due to thermal noise is at most half of its commonly quoted kT/C value. This result is corroborated by several published experimental data including data presented in this paper. The lower reset noise, however, comes at the expense of image lag. We find that alternative reset methods such as overdriving the reset transistor gate or using a pMOS transistor can alleviate lag, but at the expense of doubling the reset noise power. We propose a new reset method that alleviates lag without increasing reset noise.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel readout circuit for a pH sensitive Programmable-Gate Ion-Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (PG-ISFET) to overcome bias issues due to threshold voltage variation and increase output-referred sensitivity. Compared to other commonly-used ISFET readouts, this circuit uses two extra programmable nodes which are driven by a feedback configuration. Using the device in a source follower configuration, one node is used to evaluate and cancel the offset of the intrinsic device while the other tracks and ampli.es changes in pH. A sample and hold protocol has been developed to minimize the leakage effects and improve the pH sensing range. The system has been designed and fabricated in AMS 0.35m, to compensate for a threshold voltage variation of 10.5V and provide a pH sensitivity of 200mV/pH. 2009 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The development and preliminary evaluation of a very large pH-sensitive ISFET sensor array chip is reported in this paper. The sensor array chip boasts a 1516 array of pH-ISFETs with on-chip control and readout circuits. It was designed and fabricated using a novel process which is compatible with standard CMOS technology. This process only required four new mask layers in the design stage and four extra standard processing steps in the fabrication stage. A novel signal processing technique was also employed.},

	Abstract = {A monolithic chip processing method is reported, which includes the ion sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) of the pH sensor, p-n diode of temperature sensor and readout circuit using 0.5 m double poly double metal (DPDM) standard CMOS product with UMC IC foundry company. We have designed a planar diffused silicon diode on a n-channel pH sensitive ISFET sensor to act as a temperature sensor for on-chip temperature measurement and compensation. Furthermore, the device integrated the dual sensors and readout circuit has the potential advantages of achieving, both the pH and temperature value display, with this process, the ISFET's temperature coefficient can be minimized.},
