% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:

\section{Simulated Results}
\subsection{Test Strategy}
To verify the correct operation of the circuit/sub blocks and show that they work as expected different test benches have been used. The main one is presented of figure \ref{TB_GLOBAL_DAC}. This one contains all the power supply required by the DAC to operate and a load to respect the specifications. A ready-to-use veriloga module has been provided to generate input data on \textit{SI} and the signal \textit{EN} at the specified frequency (cf. table\ref{technical_spec}). The module also produces reference output through \textit{VOUTREF} and \textit{CLK10MREF}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulated Results and Achieved Specifications}
From the output characteristic of the DAC in figure \ref{DAC_OUT} we are able to estimate the relative error of the system.
\begin{center}
$VOUT = \frac{CODE[7:0]}{255} + 0.4$
\end{center}
\begin{center}
$ERR_{rel} = \frac{|VOUT_{ideal} - VOUT_{out}|}{VOUT_{ideal}}$
\end{center}

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.24]{illustrations/DAC_OUT.png}
\caption{\label{DAC_OUT} Input/Output characteristic for the DAC}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{technical_spec} presents all the specifications extracted from the simulation and compared to the target specifications.

DNL  & Differential Non Linearity & $\leqslant$ 1/2 & $\leqslant$ 0.03 & LSB \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The final proposed design succeeded to beat all the targeted technical specifications with $\leqslant$ 0.04 \% of relative error, a power consumption of $\leqslant$ 0.5 mW, and a possible silicon area of implementation of 0.045 mm$^{2}$.
