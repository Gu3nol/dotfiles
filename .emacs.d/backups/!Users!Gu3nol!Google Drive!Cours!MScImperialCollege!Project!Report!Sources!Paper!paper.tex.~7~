\section{Circuit Implementation}
This section describes the circuit implementation derived from the system overview.

\subsection{Serial-to-Parallel Converter}
According to the specification a simple shift register could not be used in our case. The SP converter needs to 'SAMPLE' but also to 'HOLD' the values at the right time. As a result, the valid input data on the SP converter are held until the next conversion cycle and the input data on the split array keep their state during the charge of the capacitors. This topology is justified by the frequency of the input data which is too high to directly charge the capacitors, which cannot be too small for parasitics reasons.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.21]{illustrations/DAC_SP.png}
\caption{\label{DAC_SP} 8-bits shift register with \textit{EN} signal.}
\end{figure}

The SP converters is an 8-bits shift register that includes 8  positive-edge triggered D-type flip-flop with Enable signal (DFF-EN). For a single DFF-EN, when \textit{EN} is high, the cell works as a simple DFF and when \textit{EN} is low, the output \textit{Q} of the DFF is fed into the input \textit{D}. The DFF-EN works as a memory cell when \textit{EN} is low. As shown in figure \ref{DAC_SP}, each output \textit{Q} of the DFF-EN represent a bit from MSB to LSB.

\subsection{Charge-Scaling DAC}
\subsubsection{Capacitors and Attenuation Capacitor}
To implement the charge-scaling DAC, it is essential for good matching issues between the attenuation capacitor and the charge-splitting capacitances to construct all the capacitor using a unit capacitor $C_{unit}$.

As described in \cite{ref:Hasting}, the minimum size that ensures matching between capacitors is 20$\upmu$m$\times$20$\upmu$m. The existence of a parasitic capacitance at the top plate of the capacitor array due to the op-amp and the area specification also determine the size of the capacitances.

In order to respect those conditions, the attenuation capacitor is designed using series and parallel combinations with the minimum number of $C_{unit}$ capacitances (7 capacitors are used).

\begin{center}
   $C_{atten} = \left( \frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{5} \right) \cdot C_{unit} =\frac{16}{15} \cdot C_{unit}$
\end{center}
\bigbreak

\subsubsection{OpAmp}
To ensure the good operation of the DAC and the voltage regulators, a two stages OpAmp -- using a compensation capacitor -- has been implemented. As high open-loop gain and high gain bandwidth product is requested, the transistors parameters of the 1$^{st}$ and the 2$^{nd}$ stage of the OpAmp have to be precisely settled.\cite{ref:Tsividis&Gray}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{illustrations/DAC_OpAmp.png}
\caption{\label{DAC_OpAmp} Two stages OpAmp with compensation capacitor}
\end{figure}

The design procedure is inspired from \cite{ref:Mahattanakul}. By sizing larger critically transistors the matching has been taken into account. The size of the transistors of the differential pair are $L_{n} $ = 2$\upmu$m and $W_{n} $ = 8$\upmu$m. To improve stability and reduce ripples at the output\cite{ref:Palmisano&Paumbo}, a compensation capacitor $C_{c}  = 460 fF$ is used. However, the OpAmp is set to present an intermediate quality factor $Q = \frac{1}{2}$ -- it is critically damped -- to improve speed. To drive the required output load, the transistors sizes of the buffer stage are chosen larger.

The simulation results show that the OpAmp presents an open-loop gain of 60 dB, with a cut-off frequency $f_{c} $ = 10 kHz and a phase margin $\Phi$M = 50$\arcdeg$.

\subsubsection{Biasing circuit}
To work properly, the designed two stage OpAmp needs a biasing circuit. From \cite{ref:Baker}\cite{ref:Razavi}\cite{ref:Johns&Martin}, the design of a $\beta$-multiplier circuit has been selected to provide a biasing current $I_{bias} $ = 8$\upmu$A required by the OpAmp. To ensure, to proper function of the $\beta$-multiplier, a start-up circuit has been added to \enquote*{kick start} the system.

%\begin{figure}[!ht]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{illustrations/DAC_OpAmp_Biais.png}
%\caption{\label{DAC_OpAmp_Biais} $\beta$-multiplier circuit use as biasing source for the OpAmp.}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Other sub-systems}
\subsubsection{Output clock}
A ring oscillator -- time delay oscillator that uses an odd number of inverters attached in a chain -- with 5 stages has been designed to produce an output oscillation frequency of 10 MHz at 27$\degC$. To set the inverters sizes and reach the correct oscillation frequency, with minimum skew or jitter, the delay between each stage has been increased. Figure \ref{RO_sch} presents the architecture of the DAC's 10 MHz clock.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.21]{illustrations/DAC_OUT_CLOCK.png}
\caption{\label{RO_sch}Schematic of the Ring Oscillator}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Voltage references}
In order to produce an analogue output for the DAC from 0.4V to 1.4V, the system needs to create these two references from the input voltage reference \textit{VREF} = 0.9V. To ensure this, two differential amplifier circuits have been used. A non-inverting amplifier circuit produces the voltage reference $V_{ref+} $ = 1.4V, and an inverting amplifier produces $V_{ref-} $ = 0.4V.

%In both cases, the differential amplifier used is the same OpAmp as in the charge-scaling circuit. The buffer of the OpAmp helps to drive the capacitive loads in the charge-scaling array.

\section{Simulated Results}
\subsection{Test Strategy}
To verify the correct operation of the circuit/sub blocks and show that they work as expected different test benches have been used. The main one is presented of figure \ref{TB_GLOBAL_DAC}. This one contains all the power supply required by the DAC to operate and a load to respect the specifications. A ready-to-use veriloga module has been provided to generate input data on \textit{SI} and the signal \textit{EN} at the specified frequency (cf. table\ref{technical_spec}). The module also produces reference output through \textit{VOUTREF} and \textit{CLK10MREF}.

\subsection{Simulated Results and Achieved Specifications}
From the output characteristic of the DAC in figure \ref{DAC_OUT} we are able to estimate the relative error of the system.
\begin{center}
$VOUT = \frac{CODE[7:0]}{255} + 0.4$
\end{center}
\begin{center}
$ERR_{rel} = \frac{|VOUT_{ideal} - VOUT_{out}|}{VOUT_{ideal}}$
\end{center}

\section{Realisation}

\subsection{Matching Consideration: The OpAmp}
To improve the yield and matching of the transistors of the OpAmp \& biasing circuit, techniques such as interdigitation, dummy devices and guard rings have been used. It protects all the transistors that need to be critically matched, especially the input differential pair.

\subsection{Matching Consideration: The Charge-Splitting Capacitance}
As the precision of the capacitive ratio is essential for the performance of the DAC\cite{ref:Moon&Temes}, it is important to generate a highly matched common-centroid layout with minimum parasitic capacitance induced from routing. Moreover, the ratio of the capacitor array must be kept close to 1.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.31]{illustrations/SC_array.png}
\caption{\label{SC_array}Common centroid configuration of the capacitive array}
\end{figure}

The configuration of figure \ref{SC_array} has been used for this work. It ensures the maximum matching between the capacitance of the array (attenuation capacitances + LSB/MSB capacitances) and the global symmetry of the array (metal path + capacitances). Dummy capacitance and guard rings have been included to reach a uniform etching.

\subsection{Floorplan and Layout}
The figures \ref{DAC_floorplan} and \ref{DAC_layout} present the proposed implementation of the system using the gpdk180 technology from Cadence Virtuoso.  The analog part and digital part of the system are as far away as possible to avoid parasitic influences and noise coupling. Substrate/well contacts have been added as much as possible to maintain the potential to the ground and sink spontaneous current.

The utilisation of metal paths have been properly thought to respect the rules of a \enquote*{good analog layout}. \cite{ref:Hasting}\cite{ref:Allen&Holdberg}

\section{Conclusion}
In this report an implementation of the split array charge-scaling DAC was presented. It used a split array of capacitors to convert the data from digital to analog. Although the parasitic and matching analysis were not required, both device matching and parasitic optimization have been taken into particular consideration for the design/implementation of the system.

The experimental results have shown that the DAC beats all the targeted specifications with relative margins.  In a conventional IC design process, the next step of this work would be to realize a post-layout-simulation and a parasitic extraction to improve and correct the proposed architecture.
