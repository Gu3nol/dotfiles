\section{Motivation}

\PARstart{A}{pril} $25^{th}$ $1953$, two young researchers - Francis Crick, 36, and James Watson, 24 years - published the results of their research in an article of the journal Nature accompanied by some drawings.~\citep{RefWorks:150} Few researchers would then realize the importance of this discovery and it took almost ten years to the scientific community to notice the real revolution engendered by this work. In the early 50's the DNA is no longer unknown to scientists, yet they totally ignore its shape. Watson and Crick have shown that DNA has a spiral structure in the form of double helix. With this fundamental discovery, the genetic code can now be decrypted.

Nowadays, thanks to the progress of biotechnology and sixty years after the discovery of DNA, the genetic code of many species has been decrypted. The one of the human was in 2003, and the sequences of our about 30 000 genes are still studied by scientists all around the world. Indeed, the DNA is present everywhere in the kingdom of the living organism. From tge understanding of diseases to the creation of beauty cream including the forensic investigations, this molecule and its apprehension has become a major issue in our modern societies.

However the study of this complex structure is not so accessible has it costs a lot of money. This thesis represents a straight continuation of the idea that the genome should be accessible to all and contribute of the goal of ``the \$1,000 genome''.~\citep{RefWorks:127} With this aim, a popular solution for modern chemical sensing application has been presented for integrating chemical sensors into solid state platforms. This strategy converge into the concept of Lab-On-Chip (LOC) which perpetuate the continuous trend of scaling the transistor' feature size this time in bio-medical and biochemical areas.

This development is possible through the use of new components that translate chemical information into electrical information. This electrical signal can then be processed and configure using modern techniques and signal processing electronics. One of the currently used component it the ISFET which is able to perform pH measurements thus DNA sequencing. However, ISFETs are not ideal components and present defects that need to be compensated to achieve effective measures.

Bio-electronic designers are looking to integrate more and more sensors on a space which is getting smaller. Nevertheless, Nature if full of fascinatingly organized form and patterns and some systems are inspired by biology to make more efficient electronic systems. This is the case with the honeycomb which is the most compact structure existing. From this idea, some designers had the idea to conceive DNA microarrays with sensing wells presenting an hexagonal shape and thus creating a honeycomb type structure. It allows to minimize space and increase the density sensor. How far can we actually take this? Is it possible to create a hexagonal transistor that would offer better integration density?

Therefore, enclosed-gate transistor structures and especially hexagonal transistors with their properties should be studied. Is it possible to apply this technology to DNA sequencing applications? Investigations have shown that EGTs present many advantages in term of density, speed and stray capacitances. The question is then to know if they are is beneficial for this bio-electronic. The idea of this work is to explore the possibility of the hexagonal structure transistors adapted to pH-sensing.

This thesis presents a new implementation of ISFETs based on a hexagonal design. The characterization of these structures has been made through simulations with the software suite Cadence Virtuoso in 0.18 $\mu m$ and 0.35 $\mu m$ technology. Different structures and different sizes were tested to evaluate the transistor performances. Finally, a complete prototype that meets the specifications of the technology used was made to perform future experiments. The system includes a characterization array and a sensing array of 64x64 pixels. On one hand, the hexagonal ISFETs is integrated into a complete system to ensure pH measurements, whereas on the other hand characterization of the structure is used to evaluate experimentally the performances of a hexagonal ISFET with respect to conventional structure.

It is the first time that such a hexagonal structure is applied in the field of ISFETs and DNA sequencing.

\section{Challenges}
The main challenges addressed by this thesis are outlined below;

\begin{enumerate}
\item Development of a novel geometry based on enclosed-gate transistor in the form of an hexagonal transistor. The transistor must be implemented in standard AMS 0.35 $\mu m$ CMOS technology. Adaptation to the technology should be made in order to realize the structures.
\item Study the advantages of hexagonal transistor over regular rectangular structures in term of parasitics capacitances, attenuation, size and area.
\item The possible impact of the geometry and technology scaling must be determined through a range of different sizes including the 0.35 $\mu m$ and 0.18 $\mu m$ CMOS technology.
\item Create a characterization structure with all the necessary requirement to evaluate the performance of hexagonal ISFET with respect of a corresponding rectangular transistor. The hexagonal ISFET should overcome the parasitic capacitance defect of ISFETs to be beneficial.
\item A pixel architecture must be derived from the hexagonal ISFET and its performance characterized. This pixel is destined to be incorporated in a compact array to be part of a pH based DNA microarray using ISFETs as chemical sensors.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Thesis outline}
Chapter~\ref{chap:Background} is based on introducing all the necessary background knowledge to understand the work presented in this thesis. A brief review is done on DNA sequencing before presenting a an actual ion semiconductor sensor, the ISFET. Several considerations about packing in microarray and enclosed gate transistor are also exposed as a possible improvement.

Chapter~\ref{chap:LiteratureReview} presents the latest development about ISFETs as pH-sensors in the literature. The model of ISFETs is completed and readout techniques presented. At the end of the chapter, various analysis on EGTs and hexagonal transistors are given to figure out of non-regular transistors.

A pixel architecture based on an hexagonal transistor is described in Chapter~\ref{chap:VBioinspiredpHSensor}. The performance of the hexagonal transistor and a pros ed architecture are explained first. Then, the evaluation of the pixel simulated performances such as Input Referred Noise and sensitivity are brought to light.

Chapter~\ref{chap:SystemArchitecture} focus on the system-on-chip implementation of the pixel created as well as a characterization system to evaluate the efficiency of the device in practice. The design and specification consed ration are summarized and simulations are presented to guarantee the typical system execution.

Chapter~\ref{chap:Conclusion} concludes upon the developments presented in this thesis as well as presenting a generalized a generalized evaluation. Aspect of possible improvements and future work are finally established.
