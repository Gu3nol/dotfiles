\section{The DNA sequencing, a typical micro-array application}
\label{sec:DNA_seq}
To appreciate the challenges of DNA sequencing a brief explanation on the basics of genetic and DNA is necessary.

\subsubsection{What is DNA?}
DNA also known as desoxyribonucleique acid is a biological macromolecule present in every living cells and in some viruses. DNA contains all the genetic information, called genotype, which ensure the development and the correct operations of living organisms.

The DNA molecule consists of two biopolymer strands known as polynucleotides. Each monomere constituting of the strands is called a nucleotide which is formed by a phosphate group of chemical composition \chemform{PO_4}, a monosaccharide sugar known as desoxyribose and a nitrogen-containing nucleobase. There are four different nucleotides denote by the name of their four different nucleobases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T).

\caption{\footnotesize Representation of the DNA.}
\label{Fig:RepDNA}
\end{figure}

According to the model of J.D. Watson and F.H.C. Crick developed in 1953~\citep{RefWorks:150}, the two strands of nucleotides are tied together by hydrogen bonding's and formed an hybrid molecule shapes as a double helix. These two filaments present two major properties;
\begin{my_itemize}
\item Antiparallelism: the two strands are aligned in opposite directions to one another as shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:DNA_helix}
\item Complementarity: each adenine of one strand is bound to a thymine of the other strand by two hydrogen bridges (A=T \& T=A) and each guanine of a strand is bound to a cytosine by three hydrogen bridges (C$\equiv$G \& G$\equiv$C).
\end{my_itemize}
Thus if we write in order, from the 3' end to the 5' end, the letters given on each strands of the Fig.~\ref{Fig:DNA_chem}, the following sequence is obtained;
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ l c c c c r }
  - - - & T & G & A & C & - - - \\
  - - - & A & C & T & A & - - - \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{What is the gene expression?}
The biosynthesis of a protein requires in the DNA structure a sequence of nucleotide which contains all the necessary information. This sequence is the gene of the protein as the string presented in Fig.~\ref{Fig:gene_seq}. Despite the fact that it is difficult to read, it contains all the information to synthesize a protein, in this case the Apolipoprotein A-II. The DNA strain containing the gene is called the ``sense'' strain whereas the other one is the ``antisense'' strain.~\citep{RefWorks:141}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Figs/Chap1/gene_seq.png}
  \caption{\footnotesize Example of genetic sequence.}
  \label{Fig:gene_seq}
\end{figure}

The various mechanism set up to translate the information from a gene to the synthesis of a functional product is the gene expression. Then the genome is the whole genetic material of an organism encoded in his DNA.

Each cell division is preceded by a DNA replication leading to chromosome replication. This process normally retains the genetic information of the cell as long as each of the two daughter cells inherit a complete gene pool identical to the mother cell. Sometimes, this process is not operating normally and the cell's genetic information is modified. This permanent change of the nucleotide sequence of a gene is a genetic mutation.

\subsubsection{Why do we use DNA sequencing?}
Mutations or alterations of the genotype may either remain without any effects or can alter the gene expression or whether prevent the gene from working properly. Thus mutations produce discernible changes on the phenotype, \textit{i.e.} the observable characteristics of an organism. However, mutations are part in normal biological processes as evolution, development of the immune system and abnormal processes such as cancer or specific genetic disorders.~\citep{RefWorks:141}

In order to ``decode'' the instructions stored in a DNA molecule, the sequence of its bases must be determined. It is this ``reading'' of the sequence which is called DNA sequencing. As it is aforementioned, unlike reading a text, sequencing of DNA only delivers a long text of A, T, C and G in which the information are not immediately discernible. An interpretive step, called annotation is needed to identify the instructions and then understand the biological sense.

The genome and its operation is a crucial information about the well-functioning of a living organism. The creation of exhaustive inventory of the human genes is the main reason for sequencing programs. The understanding of genes is indeed a necessary step to perceive biological phenomena at the molecular and cellular level.

In the future, the applications of sequencing will be more and more numerous in the fields of medicine and pharmaceutical, biotechnology, food processing, as well as in other areas in direct contact with the biological processes (agriculture, environment). Such examples are the detection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), which allows to determine the reaction of a patient to a treatment, or the complete sequencing of the genome to prevent some cancers or genetic diseases. All the possible applications of DNA sequencing justifies the search for effective and affordable sequencing technologies.

\subsubsection{How to perform DNA sequencing?}
DNA sequencing was invented in the second half of the 1970s. Two methods have been developed independently by the team of Walter Gilbert in the United States and the team of Frederick Sanger in the UK. Both methods are based on opposite principles: Sanger approach is a method by selective enzymatic synthesis while that of Maxam and Gilbert is a method by selective chemical degradation.

Meanwhile, DNA micro-arrays also known as bio-chip or DNA chip were developed as an other approach to perform DNA sequencing with better throughput. As shown Fig.~\ref{Fig:DNA_micro} it is a set of DNA molecules fixed in ordered rows on a small area which may be glass, silicon or plastic. This recent biotechnology is used to analyze the genes into cells, tissues, organs, or complex mixtures, at a given time and in a given state with respect to a reference sample.
\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{Figs/Chap1//DNA_microarray.png}
  \caption{\footnotesize Basic operation principle of DNA microarrays.~\citep{RefWorks:151}}
  \label{Fig:DNA_micro}
\end{figure}

DAN micro-arrays are based on the property that a ``denatured'' DNA strand tends to spontaneously reform the double helix when presented to its complementary strand. Thus the DNA strands in the sample to analyze will bond to the complementary strands on the DNA chip, this is the hybridization reaction. For instance, if a patient has a disease, extracts of retro-transcribed DNA strand will hybridize with representative synthetic DNA strands of the disease. Then, the binding can be detected by different methods. Optical based methods use a fluorescent dye added to the DNA sample to detect hybridized pairs using a microscope. Some semiconductor based techniques use CMOS sensors or MEMS cantilevers to detect any bonding.

\subsubsection{What is CMOS microarray?}
As mentioned in the previous subsection some DNA microarrays are based on CMOS techniques. According to the Moore's scaling law the utilization of CMOS processes allows to integrate more and more sensors on a chip as well as decreasing the cost.~\citep{RefWorks:117} It differs from optical sequencing methods which required expensive and large components such as lenses and cameras. A commercially genetic sequencing system a sensing array is demonstrated in~\citep{RefWorks:128}.

\caption{\footnotesize Electron micrographs of micro-wells for DNA microarray.}
\label{Fig:DNA_well}
\end{figure}
Different technologies are used to perform DNA sequencing. This thesis focus on a technique known as ion semiconductor sequencing which uses specific CMOS sensors to detect a variation of pH due to hybridization. In any cases CMOS microarrays require multiple wells on top of sensors to contain the DNA sample to analyze as it is shown on Fig.~\ref{Fig:DNA_well}

CMOS-based microarrays open the way to high-throughput and high parallelism~\citep{RefWorks:110} for fast and cost-effective systems.

\subsubsection{High-throughput sequencing?}
High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) also known as NGS for Next-Generation Sequencing refers to a set of methods that emerged from 2005 which produce millions of sequences in one run for a low cost. Pyrosequencing and novel hybridization methods belongs to these new techniques. They are characterized by the use of massive parallel approaches to sequence hundreds of thousands of fragments simultaneously.~\citep{RefWorks:120} They are freed of the cloning steps and formations of genomic libraries. They allow sequencing directly from single DNA molecules.

In this case nucleotides are not added together as in a normal sequencing reaction but one after the other (cf. Fig.~\ref{Fig:DNA_pyro}). If the nucleotide added to the reaction medium corresponds to the one expected by the polymerase (parent strand), it is incorporated into the growing strand (elongation) and releases chemical species such as a pyrophosphate \chemform{PP_i} and a proton \chemform{H+}, as presented in~\ref{Fig:DNA_hybrid}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.23]{Figs/Chap1//DNA_hybridization.png}
  \caption{\footnotesize Reaction of DNA hybridization.}
  \label{Fig:DNA_hybrid}
\end{figure}

For pH-sequencing a reaction leads to a drop in pH, the sequencer or more precisely a pH-sensor will detect the chemical evolution of protons in solution signal and produce the form of a peak on the output signal. The height of this peak is a function of the pH-intensity signal itself proportional to the number of nucleotides incorporated at the same time. (Fig.~\ref{Fig:DNA_seq}) The gene sequence is deduced from the size of the peaks obtained. Moreover, in case of mixture of nucleotides at the same position (sequence polymorphism), the size of the peaks provides a quantification of the proportion of nucleotides present on the growing strand.

\section{pH sensing using ISFETs}
\label{sec:pH_ISFET}
The core of this work is to improve pH-based DNA micro-arrays. This section presents a well-known and interesting CMOS pH sensor: the Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor. (ISFET)

\subsection{CMOS ISFET model}
\subsubsection{Overview}
The ISFET transistor is a chemically sensitive device based on a FET transistors. Its behavior is very similar to MOSFETs with the difference that it depends on the ion concentration of the solution in contact with the gate of the terminal. The sensitivity to a chemical specie is due to the sensing membrane which replaces the polysicon gate and metal.~\citep{RefWorks:117}

In the case of pH detection, the insulating membrane requires no extra proceeding. Indeed, hydrogen ions can bind to the standard passivation layer used on commercial CMOS technology, generally silicon nitride \chemform{Si_3N_4} or silicon oxynitride \chemform{SiO_xN_y}. Then in a aqueous solution containing \chemform{H+}, the protons are trapped by this sensing membrane and modulate the threshold voltage of the device. Completed with an external readout circuit the ISFET implements a low cost monolithic pH sensor with fast response.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Figs/Chap1//MOSFET_ISFET.png}
  \caption{\footnotesize Schematic representation of MOSFET (a) and ISFET (b).~\citep{RefWorks:125}}
  \label{Fig:ISFETmodel}
\end{figure}

A reference electrode (usually \chemform{Ag/AgCl}) is used to bias the solution and establish a stable phase boundary. As a consequence, the variation of threshold voltage relies on pH only.

\subsubsection{Operation}
For a MOSFET transistor, the threshold voltage is given by the Eq.~\ref{mosfet_vt}. There the first term is the work function difference between the gate metal and the silicon, respectively $\Phi_{m}$ and $\Phi_{Si}$. The second term reflects the accumulated charges in the oxide $Q_{ox}$, at the oxide-silicon interface $Q_{ss}$ and the depletion region $Q_{B}$. The last term is related to the Fermi potential which depends on the doping concentration of the silicon. All these terms are physical.
\begin{equation}
  V_{th(MOSFET)} = \frac{\Phi_{m} - \Phi_{Si}}{q} - \frac{Q_{ox} + Q_{ss} + Q_{B}}{C_{ox}} + 2\Phi_{f}
\label{mosfet_vt}
\end{equation}

In the Eq.~\ref{isfet_vt} the expression for the threshold voltage of the ISFET is deduced from the previous expression. This time it depends on a chemical contribution and can be described as a shift of the MOSFET threshold voltage due to the ions in solution.
\begin{equation}
  V_{th(ISFET)} = V_{th(MOSFET)} + V_{chem}
\label{isfet_vt}
\end{equation}

As reported by~\citep{RefWorks:123} the chemically related terms $V_{chem}$ is given as in Eq.~\ref{v_chem_1}, where $E_{ref}$ is the reference electrode potential, $\Phi_{0}$ is a chemical potential related to pH~\citep{RefWorks:146} and $\chi_{sol}$ is the potential due to dipole molecules in the solution. Because $E_{ref}$ is constant and $\chi_{sol}$ is dependent on solution composition, only the term $\Phi_{0}$ explains the pH dependency of the ISFET.
\begin{equation}
V_{chem} = E_{ref} + \Phi_{0} + \chi_{sol} - \frac{\Phi_{m}}{q}
\label{v_chem_1}
\end{equation}
The Nerst equation relates the pH to the reaction quotient and then the pH of a solution. According to this the maximum sensitivity of a gold standard pH electrode is typically $S_{n} = 2.3 \alpha U_{t} \approx 59mV$. $U_{t}$ is the thermal voltage equal to $\frac{k T}{q}$ where $k$ is the Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is the temperature and $q$ the proton charge.

However, due to various electrochemical effects occurring at the interface between the solution and the semiconductor, the sensitivity is less than the ideal Nerstian response. As a consequence, the expression of $V_{chem}$ defined in~\citep{RefWorks:147} and shown in Eq.~\ref{v_chem_2} is more intuitive to describe the chemical behavior of the ISFET.
\begin{equation}
V_{chem} = \gamma + 2.3\alpha U_{t}\ pH
\label{v_chem_2}
\end{equation}

The terms $\gamma$ groups all the non-chemically related potentials and $\alpha$ is a value comprised between 0 and 1 which describes the deviation from the ideal sensitivity.

From the model depicted above, ``it may be concluded that an ISFET is electronically %le mot précédent se coupe au milieu d'une syllabe, attention%  identical to a MOSFET and can thus still be seen as an electronic device, with one additional feature: the possibility to chemically modify the threshold voltage via the interfacial potential at the electrolyte/oxide interface.''~\citep{RefWorks:125}

Finally, the ISFET operations in weak inversion and in strong inversion are given respectively by Eq.~\ref{isfet_weak_inv} and Eq.~\ref{isfet_strong_inv}.
\begin{equation}
  I_{D} = I_{0}\ exp \left (\frac{V_{GS} - V_{chem}}{nU_{T}} \right) \left [1 - exp\left ( \frac{-V_{DS}}{nU_{T}} \right ) \right ]
\label{isfet_weak_inv}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  I_{D} = \frac{1}{2} \mu_{n} C_{ox} \frac{W}{L} \ (V_{GS} - V_{chem} - V_{th(MOSFET)})^2 \ (1+\lambda V_{DS})
\label{isfet_strong_inv}
\end{equation}
with;
\begin{my_itemize}
\item $\mu_{n}$ the effective mobility of the charge-carriers,
\item $C_{ox}$ the capacitance of the oxide layer,
\item $W$ and $L$ respectively the gate width and length
\item $\lambda$ the channel-length modulation parameter
\item $I_{0}$ the current at the onset of inversion
\item $n$ the slope factor defined by n = 1 + $\frac{C_{D}}{C_{ox}}$, where $C_{D}$ is the capacitance of the depletion layer.
\end{my_itemize}

\subsubsection{ISFET macromodel}
Since the development of ISFET in the 70's, the fabrication of pH-sensitive devices using the commercial CMOS technology is essential to ensure availability, compatibility and scalability of this technology. The first example of a very large ISFET sensor array chip fully fabricated using a standard CMOS process has been shown in 1997 by~\citep{RefWorks:138}. The implementation in unmodified CMOS is possible by using the ``extended gate'' approach shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:ISFETmodel}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.20]{Figs/Chap1//ISFET_unmod_CMOS.png}
  \caption{\footnotesize ISFET fabricated in commercial CMOS using the ``extended gate''.~\citep{RefWorks:123}}
  \label{Fig:ISFETmodel}
\end{figure}

The top passivation layer inherent in all CMOS processes is used as the pH sensing layer and is connected to the polysilicon gate of the transistor using the intermediate metal layers and vias.~\citep{RefWorks:139} For this reason, the implementation of ISFET in CMOS results in the addition of a passivation capacitance at the gate of the FET.

Two additional electrochemical capacitances (double-layer capacitances~\citep{RefWorks:148}) must be included in the ISFET macromodel (Fig.~\ref{Fig:ISFETmodel}). These are due to the distribution of charge at the interface of the sensing area and are called the Gouy-Chapman and Helmholz capacitances. As stated by~\citep{RefWorks:149}, it should be noticed that passivation capacitance is several orders of magnitude smaller than the double-layer capacitances.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.20]{Figs/Chap1//ISFET_model.png}
  \caption{\footnotesize ISFET macromodel.~\citep{RefWorks:123}}
  \label{Fig:ISFETmodel}
\end{figure}

All these capacitances (passivation \& chemicals) scale the gate voltage through a capacitive divider (from G to G' and then G' to G'') and modify the performance of the sensor. The complete model of the effect of these capacitances will be described in Chapter~\ref{chap:LiteratureReview}.

\subsection{ISFET defects}
Whereas the ISFETs macromodel defined in the previous section is useful to explain the general behavior of the component, it suffers from nonidealities resulting in a deviation of the intrinsic characteristics of the transistor. These defects need to be compensated to perform pH measurement with accuracy.

\subsubsection{Temperature dependency}
As any electronic device, the ISFET is sensitive to the temperature variations.~\citep{RefWorks:111} This dependency is a combination of the MOSFET thermal coefficient of the ISFET and the electrode-electrolyte-insulator parameter (the $\gamma$ coefficient in the expression of $V_{chem}$).

Other factors, including the reference electrode, the measuring electronics and the solution itself participate to create an overall negative temperature coefficient for the threshold voltage of the ISFET. It ranges between $-0.5 mV/\degC$ to $-12 mV/\degC$.~\citep{RefWorks:113}

In the rest of this thesis, the influence of temperature on the ISFET output will be taken in account considering the ISFET as a simple MOSFET. Any others factor is ignored to focus on the device itself.

\subsubsection{Trapped charges}
During the standard CMOS fabrication process trapped charges are left in the passivation layer or on the floating gate of the transistor.~\citep{RefWorks:104} Since the polysilicon gate of an ISFET is only connected to metal which is floating, the charges captured on the layers can not escape.~\citep{RefWorks:114} This result as a an offset of the threshold voltage of the transistor and a large threshold voltage deviation from one device to another as presented in Fig.~\ref{Fig:trapped_charges}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Figs/Chap1/trapped_charges.png}
  \caption{\footnotesize Influence of the trapped charges on the $I_{D}-V_{gs}$ curves.~\citep{RefWorks:118}}
  \label{Fig:trapped_charges}
\end{figure}

As a consequence for two ISFETs fabricated with the same process the output response of the device will react differently for the same value of pH. A change in the threshold voltage and then the characteristic of the device can also appear during the reuse of the same device.

\subsubsection{The electrical and chemical noise}
The noise model of the ISFET is described by two different contributions. On the one hand, the electrical noise of the device is related to the MOSFET underlying the macromodel of the device. On the other hand, the chemical noise is due to the chemical interface between the solution and the electrode (the gate). These two types of noise present different behaviors.

The electrical noise respects the definitions of noises in solid-state device. This includes thermal noise~\citep{RefWorks:108}, shot noise and flicker noise~\citep{RefWorks:140}, thermal and shot noise. The chemical counterpart is a correlated chemical noise. It exhibits a 1/f relationship due to the slow chemical response. The work presented in~\citep{RefWorks:119} defines the contributions of noise in the ISFET as in Eq.~\ref{isfet_noise}, where $C_{Tfg}$ refers to the equivalent floating gate capacitance and $K$ is ``the chemical related effect due to long-term electrode degradation and surface chemical noise.''~\citep{RefWorks:119}.
\begin{equation}
  \overline{V_{n}^2(ISFET)} = \underbrace{\left (\frac{C_{Tfg}}{C_{pass}} \right) ^ 2\frac{K_{f}}{WLC'_{ox}f}}_{MOSFET} + \underbrace{\frac{K}{f}}_{Chemical}
\label{isfet_noise}
\end{equation}

Although the ISFET acts as a MOSFET and then presents mostly thermal and flicker noise, the low frequency flicker-like chemical noise dominates. Fig.~\ref{Fig:ISFET_noise} shows that at low frequency ISFET is found one order of magnitude higher than its MOSFET counterpart.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Figs/Chap1//ISFET_noise.png}
  \caption{\footnotesize Estimation of the low-frequency noise of ISFETs with the same electrical area~\citep{RefWorks:119}}
  \label{Fig:ISFET_noise}
\end{figure}

However, in the next parts of this thesis the chemical noise contribution will be assumed negligible to focus on intrinsic noise and behavior of the ISFET devices studied.

\subsubsection{Drift}
The instability of the DC operating point of ISFETs devices is also affected by drift. This phenomenon which is defined as a very low frequency correlated noise appears as a continuous monotonic change in the output response of the device without variation of the input signal. In our case, the threshold voltage (and thus the drain current) changes in the absence of pH variation.~\citep{RefWorks:109}

The long term drift of ISFETs compare to MOSFETs fabricated on the same process is presented in Fig.~\ref{Fig:ISFET_drift} and demonstrates that the drift of ISFETs is at least 3 times larger than its MOS counterpart. The trend of the drift is an exponential characteristic.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Figs/Chap1//ISFET_drift.png}
  \caption{\footnotesize Evolution of the drift for devices fabricated with the same process.~\citep{RefWorks:119}}
  \label{Fig:ISFET_drift}
\end{figure}

It should be notice that ``Although 1/f noise is believed to manifest itself as an apparent drift, our results clearly demonstrate that the physical bases for these two phenomena are entirely different.''~\citep{RefWorks:112}
The influence of drift is more critical because the 1/f noise imposes a negligible influence and does not affect the ``lower limit on the frequency of the monitored stimuli.''~\citep{RefWorks:112}

\section{The honeycomb}
\label{sec:Honeycomb}

In the Section~\ref{sec:DNA_seq} we have seen the interest of DNA micro-arrays and the organization of the sensing wells. As a consequence designers need to find the best solution to arrange the wells and obtain the most compact structure.

Moreover, in Mathematics, any area covered completely by identical plane shapes without overlapping and regardless of their design (regular convex, irregular and concave, with straight or curved edges) is called a tiling. In this way, for the well of our micro-array, we need to find the best shape yet all shapes such as squares, rectangles, hexagons, triangles or even Escher's tiling are possible. The only constraint is on the area of the shapes; each shapes must have the same surface.

\textit{Which shape should be selected?}
One point that would be interesting would be minimizing the amount of material necessary to create the sides of the wells. Then, the shape with the smallest perimeter should be used.

\textit{But which geometric shape for a given surface has the smallest perimeter?}
The response has long been known: it is the disc. Yet, discs can not make a compact tiling, so a geometric shape that has the smallest perimeter and allow to cover completely an area has to be used.

\subsubsection{The honeycomb conjecture}
The answer to the problem presented previously is known since the Greek Antiquity. The solution is to use regular hexagons. However, even though the answer is admitted for more than two thousand years, nobody managed to give a proper demonstration of this solution. This is only in 1999 that the mathematician Thomas Hale provided a rigorous proof of this result.~\citep{RefWorks:61}

The honeycomb conjecture states that the regular hexagonal grid or honeycomb divides a surface into regions of equal area with the least total perimeter, this is the optimum tiling.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figs/Chap1//honeycomb.jpg}
  \footnotesize \textit{``[The honeycomb is] absolutely perfect in economizing labor and wax.''\\
 Charles Darwin}
  \label{Fig:ISFET_noise}
\end{figure}
Nature is well designed, so it is not a surprise that the utilization of hexagonal structures is found among the animal and plant kingdoms, including the well-known example of cells of the honeycombs created by the bees. As the hexagon minimizes the amount of material used to build the walls, it can diminish the amount of wax used to create the cavities. The fact that bees use the hexagonal tiling as the best tilling gave its name to the honeycomb conjecture.

The industry was largely inspired by honeycombs and now offers cellular structures that offer an amazing strength for a reduced cost since 95\% of these structures is composed of vacuum. The honeycomb structures serve to strengthen the resistance of a component while ensuring maximum lightness. The honeycomb may be made of aluminum, paper, cardboard or synthetic plastics material.

\subsubsection{Packing of equal spheres}
The hexagonal tilling and honeycomb is also related to the densest packing of equal circle in a plane. More generally, the dense sphere packing refers to the question: how to arrange spheres in the space in order to have the greatest density without overlapping?

This is a problem which arises in general Euclidean geometry in three-dimensional space, but which can also be generalized to the Euclidean plane (the spheres are replaced by circles), in a Euclidean space of $n$ dimensions $(n > 3)$, with hyper-spheres, or in a non-Euclidean space.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{Figs/Chap1//circle_packing.png}
  \caption{\footnotesize Dense circle packing in a square space.}
  \label{Fig:circle_pack}
\end{figure}
As shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:circle_pack} the hexagonal shape is the most compact organization when we arrange circles of the same area in an appropriately sized enclosure. Carl Friedrich Gauss proved that no other regular patterns is denser. It is not the case when the spheres do not have the same size.

The surface density of this arrangement is;
\begin{equation}
    d = \frac{\pi}{2 \sqrt{3}} \simeq 0.9069
\label{density_hex}
\end{equation}
Every circle is tangent to 6 other circles which fill just over 90\% of the area of the plane.

\subsubsection{Conclusions}
Compactness matters. The more compact your structure, the more you can place wells on the DNA micro-array allowing HTS sequencing. The hexagonal tilling is the most effective %effective what ? choice ?%, superior to any non-convex and any paving comprising one or more curved sides.

In the next step of this work, we are going to analyze this hexagonal shape and see the possible application to the transistor geometry as well as the pros and the cons of such architecture.

\section{High speed, small area and good matching applications}
\label{sec:HEX_app}
In Section~\ref{sec:pH_ISFET}, the ISFET model is presented as a MOSFET transistor with the gate as a reference electrode and an insulating layer sensitive to pH.

However, since the first transistor's realization in 1947, physicists and electronic engineers are looking to improve the performance of the device. This section presents a new architecture of MOSFET based on Enclosed Gate Transistors (EGTs) and their principle applications. The details on the electronic model and the performances of EGTs will be provided in Chapter~\ref{chap:LiteratureReview}.

\subsubsection{Enclosed Gate Transistors}
Enclosed Gate Transistors refer to non-conventional transistors with respect to common rectangular gate transistors (RGTs), and regroup different geometries such as the Circular Gate Transistor (CGT), the closed with $n$ sides, the donut or doughnut, the square, and the hexagonal transistors. Two types of EGTs are presented in Fig.~\ref{Fig:EGT}, it can be noticed that in all cases the gate should ``enclosed'' around the source or drain.

\caption{\footnotesize Schematics layout of Enclosed Gate Transistor}
\label{Fig:EGT}

The utilization of EGTs is more and more incorporated into new designs of integrated circuits and the various patents developed demonstrate the interest of designers to such structures. Different typologies can be found such as hexagonal structures~\citep{RefWorks:131, RefWorks:132, RefWorks:133}, CGTs~\citep{RefWorks:134} and doughnut transistors~\citep{RefWorks:62} or even non-regular geometry~\citep{RefWorks:135}.

The first application discovered for EGTs was for power systems. In~\citep{RefWorks:44}, an example of the researches for POWER devices which use EGTs is developed. For power-MOS devices, the idea is to reduce the on-resistance, increasing the breakdown voltage and the reliability. Different layout geometry designs affect the parameters of the device. It includes on-resistance, breakdown voltage and threshold voltage.

\subsubsection{High-speed application}
EGTs present properties such as minimized stray capacitances associated with drain-substrate junctions which appears particularly useful in high-frequency application. In various papers, compact architectures of EGTs are presented. They present more effective rapports between current-driving strength and active area. They %also% obtained results concerning parameters such as capacitance %to% indicate a reduction in source/drain capacitance depending of the type of EGTs chosen.~\citep{RefWorks:57}

As a consequence EGTs are used as amplifiers or phase-lock loops. For instance,~\citep{RefWorks:53} presents a compact layout scheme of EGT to fabricate a high-speed mixed-signal circuit and RF circuits. Thanks to the properties of the EGTs the results obtained show an improvement of more than ``10\% of propagation delay of buffer circuits and an increase in the unity-gain frequency and phase margin of a high-speed two-stage operational amplifier''. Using EGTs, they %they faire référence à quoi ?% are even going further by creating an active compact inductor with Q value and saving space on the final design. In this case a waffle architecture is used, which consists of multiple EGTs.
Digital high speed applications have also been tested. In~\citep{RefWorks:45} a doughnut layout style is used for CMOS logic gates to improve switching speed %. It is compared to standard ... ?% and compared with standard layout style as shown in Fig.~\ref{EGT_digital}.

  \label{Fig:EGT_digital}
\end{figure}

These gates using the doughnut style are then used for the design of a fast 30-bit incrementer. The results obtained %results are ou result is ?% a maximum propagation delay of 10ns for a 3$\mu$m process. Unfortunately, no results are given for the same structure using RGTs, yet, it demonstrates an example of application in digital for EGTs.

The last but not least applications which are close to high-speed applications are space electronics utilization's. Indeed, EGT presents an improved radiation hardness due to ``the reduction of radiation-induced oxide trapped charge characteristic of deep-submicron processes''~\citep{RefWorks:63}. The fabrication of radiation tolerant devices is relatively recent but the application in high-energy physic domains such as in space or in particle accelerator~\citep{RefWorks:82} are multiples.

\subsubsection{High-density layout style with good matching}
Although some EGTs, such as CGTs are restricted as building components in general designing, they can be used in advantageous ways in large multicell arrays. Some topologies can even be inserted in CMOS chip without any extra processing work or cost. This is especially the case with waffle (Fig. \label{Fig:EGT_waffle}) and hexagonal structures (Fig. \label{Fig:EGT_hex}).
\begin{figure}[h]

\subfigure[Compact waffle MOSFET design~\citep{RefWorks:145}]{\label{Fig:EGT_waffle}\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figs/Chap1//EGT_waffle.png}}

\caption{\footnotesize Example of two compact ECG designs}
\label{Fig:EGT_compact}
\end{figure}

We have seen that the hexagonal tilling is the densest way to arrange circles in two dimensions, then the high density of hexagonal structure is easily proven. It could also be noticed that it helps to improve the matching of the transistor, which is true for all EGT structures. The Fig.~\ref{} presents the standard deviation on the mismatch of the voltage threshold $V_{TH}$ obtain%ed% for different layout styles and different sizes.

  \caption{\footnotesize Evolution of $V_{TH}$ mismatch for different layout style~\citep{RefWorks:48}}
  \label{Fig:EGT_matching}
\end{figure}

According to this result this type of EGT structure (here the waffle) avoids systematic mismatching to follow the linear relationship with the inverse of the transistor channel area. Other sources such as~\citep{RefWorks:51} present the same advantages this time for hexagonal EGT%s% instead of waffle structures.

Finally, application of high-density layouts and CMOS technology of the previously described honeycomb structure (\textit{cf}. Section~\ref{sec:Honeycomb}) are also part of EGT structures. Automatic packing algorithms for non-Manhattan hexagon placements are presented in~\citep{RefWorks:85} and~\citep{RefWorks:86} %. They take advantage of % hexagon honeycomb in new layout organization of cells. However, even though this implementation and algorithm demonstrate a better usage of the chip area, they are still not in use.

\section{Goals}
Although different technologies %were developed% have been developed to answer the challenges of DNA sequencing, the actual goal of designers is to constantly improve DNA micro-arrays to ensure a better understanding of the DNA molecule. Thus, the idea is to reduce the size of the sensing system by improving the scalability without compromises on the robustness and the sensitivity of the device.

The ISFET pH-sensor provide a promising technology for the future of DNA sequencing. %The MOSFET is an electrical structure with a gate as a reference electrode and a insulating layer. % %Due to its MOSFET electrical structure with the gate as a reference electrode and an insulating layer% %It is sensitive to pH which modulate its output response.% Nevertheless, this chemical transistor suffers from nonidealities such as chemical noise, drift, trapped charges and classical MOSFET defects. The idea of this thesis is to focus on DNA micro-array using pH-sensing systems such as ISFETs. However, we have seen that ISFETs present passivation and chemical capacitances which affect the behavior of the device.

It has also been demonstrated that the hexagonal tilling is the densest way to arrange circles in two dimensions. In this idea, an hexagonal organization of ISFETs would be beneficial to improve the packing density of micro array. Moreover, hexagonal transistors are part of a category called enclosed-gate transistors which present interesting properties in term of speed, strain capacitance and matching. Applied to ISFETs, these properties could also improve the pH-detection. Consequently it would be interesting to focus on hexagonal transistors applied to pH-sensing.

In the end, because the ISFET sensor must be embedded into an entire system which perform pH detection with the best sensitivity,the next part focus on specific implementation of ISFET in CMOS technology. %This part% The following part will discuss of a new ISFET topology and its use in a integrated micro-array. Then, the latest consideration%s %about EGT are developed as well as the model to describe such structures.
