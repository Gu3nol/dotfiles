\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

I am currently the owner of a bank account at Barclays UK. However, I moved to France for an unlimited time and I would like to update my contact details. I cannot do it on-line as only a valid UK address can be entered.

I have already sent a previous mail. This time I am including all the necessary proof of residence.

Then, I am writing to you to give you my address using the enclosed form.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I look forward to your reply.

\closing{Regards,}

\encl{Changes to customer address form.\newline Photocopy of French National ID Card with address.\newline Photocopy of bank statement with address.}
