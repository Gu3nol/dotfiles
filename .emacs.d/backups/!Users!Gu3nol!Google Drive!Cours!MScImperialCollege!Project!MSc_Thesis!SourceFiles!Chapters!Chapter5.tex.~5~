\PARstart{T}{his} chapter presents the hardware system developed to test, characterise and demonstrate the pixel behaviour. this system includes a “standard” and a characterization array.

\section{Complete system design}
Presentation of the whole system

\section{System description}
Operation of each sub blocks

\subsection{Pixel array and row decoder}
Presentation of the 8x8 array architecture designed according to the pixel design and readout circuit.

\subsubsection{Architecture}
\subsubsection{Operation}
\subsubsection{Performance analysis}
Device densisty and other considerations.
Create a table with the #of pixel (log scale 10,100,1000) and the size for a square implentation and a hexagonal one

\section{System execution}

\section{Simulations and tests}

\section{CMOS fabricated prototype: the BATMAN chip}

\subsection{ISFET defects}
Whereas the ISFETs is a wonderful tool it presents some defaults/defects and we need to define them to use this tool in an appropriate way (compensate his defects)

\section{The DNA sequencing, a typical ISFET application}
This section presents a well-known and interesting application for the ISFETs as a pH sensor: the DNA sequencing.
Yet, to understand it we need to do a brief explanation of DNA sequencing as the basics of genetic and how DNA is made/worked.
\newline
-    What is DNA?
\newline
-    Why do we use DNA sequencing?
\newline
-     How perform DNA sequencing? (PCR / Sanger sequencing)
\newline
-     What is CMOS microarray? (non-optical genome sequencing)
\newline
-    High-throughput sequencing? (sequencing by hybridization)

\section{Goals}
Resume the goals of this thesis: Use a new architecture inspired from the nature and others areas of application in pH sensing.
Insist on the fact that it is challenging and never done before in these two fields of researches.
