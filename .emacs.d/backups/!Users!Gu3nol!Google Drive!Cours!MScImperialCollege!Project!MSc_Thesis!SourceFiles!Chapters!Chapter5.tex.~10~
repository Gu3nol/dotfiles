\PARstart{T}{his} chapter presents the hardware system developed to test, characterise and demonstrate the pixel behaviour. this system includes a “standard” and a characterization array.

\section{Complete system design}
Presentation of the whole system

\section{System description}
Operation of each sub blocks

\subsection{Pixel array and row decoder}
Presentation of the 8x8 array architecture designed according to the pixel design and readout circuit.

\subsubsection{Architecture}
\subsubsection{Operation}
\subsubsection{Performance analysis}

\subsection{Characterisation array and switches}
\subsection{Readout and conversion circuit}
Include shm of readout circuit (voltage follower, set I, observe V)
Details on the ADC requirement (resolution, characteristic, decoupling capacitor added)
Choice of the OpAmp and driving capability

\subsection{SPI}
SPI block furnish by Nicolas/Ermis. Yet, it has been modified to use only 12 bits + tested again.
This block manages the communication between the chip and the external world.
Based on std SPI implementation.

\subsection{Digital core - Control Logic Unit}
Description/Aims: FSM diagram
Input/output signals
Implementation

\section{System execution}
Order of activation, how to use the system, ways of communication with it. SPI trams/commands

\section{Simulations and tests}
Test of the CLU + TB created and implemented in VHDL/RTL
Values at the output of the array
MC simulations

\section{CMOS fabricated prototype: the BATMAN chip}
Presentation of the chip
Tests (DRC/LVS/Antenna/Post-layout simulations) on my own block.


\section{Other metrics}
\subsection{Power consumption}
\subsection{Speed consideration}
Maximum speed of operation / Nominal speed / Possible switching speed using hexgonal ISFET comparing to std structure

\subsection{Scaling}
Area of the array / area of the whole system
Device densisty and other considerations.
Create a table with the number of pixel (log scale 10,100,1000) and the size for a square implentation and a hexagonal one
