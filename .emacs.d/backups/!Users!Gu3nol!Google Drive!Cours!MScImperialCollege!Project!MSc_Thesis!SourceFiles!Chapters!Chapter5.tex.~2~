\PARstart{T}{his} chapter presents the hardware system developed to test, characterise and demonstrate the pixel behaviour. this system includes a “standard” and a characterization array.


\section{Introduction}
Presentation of two different subjects: enclosed gate (ECG)layout transistors and ISFETs
Even though there are different, the idea of this project is to include the possible benefit of the first technology (ECG) into ISFETs applications.

\section{The honeycomb}
Presentation of the honeycomb structures and some common applications (Beehives, aeronautics, electronics) + Presentation of packing advantages: the honeycomb conjecture and its application.

\section{High speed, small area and good matching applications}
Development of the main area of researches for hexagonal ISFETs and the known advantages; diminution of stray capacitance, better matching, hardness to radiation, better integration.
Main example of application; Power transistors (HexFET) for high frequency amplifiers and power applications.

\section{pH sensing using ISFETs}
In this part we are presenting a “special” transistor; how it works, the model and defects.

\subsection{CMOS ISFET model}
Standard ISFETs model: 30 years of ISFETOLOGY is the beginning

\subsection{ISFET defects}
Whereas the ISFETs is a wonderful tool it presents some defaults/defects and we need to define them to use this tool in an appropriate way (compensate his defects)

\section{The DNA sequencing, a typical ISFET application}
This section presents a well-known and interesting application for the ISFETs as a pH sensor: the DNA sequencing.
Yet, to understand it we need to do a brief explanation of DNA sequencing as the basics of genetic and how DNA is made/worked.
\newline
-    What is DNA?
\newline
-    Why do we use DNA sequencing?
\newline
-     How perform DNA sequencing? (PCR / Sanger sequencing)
\newline
-     What is CMOS microarray? (non-optical genome sequencing)
\newline
-    High-throughput sequencing? (sequencing by hybridization)

\section{Goals}
Resume the goals of this thesis: Use a new architecture inspired from the nature and others areas of application in pH sensing.
Insist on the fact that it is challenging and never done before in these two fields of researches.
