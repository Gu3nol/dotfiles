\section{Conclusion}
\PARstart{T}{his} work presented a new transistor architecture based on hexagonal honeycomb for pH sensing applications. This is a preliminary investigation regarding the behavior of an hexagonal ISFET across device sizes with respect to a standard counterpart.

During the development of the new structure the modern techniques and result of the contemporary literature were evaluated and, with respect to the envisaged project requirements, the hexagonal transistor was found to be the most promising. Indeed, hexagonal transistors present reduced parasitic capacitance and good packing properties. Moreover, researches about the ISFET and the impact of the passivation capacitance were done to understand how the new transistor will affect the pH-measurement. Then a new pseudo-hexagonal layout was presented with a model to evaluate its key parameters. However some adaptations had to be done due to the design constraints of the technology used (standard CMOS AMS 0.18 and 0.35 $\mu m$). As a consequence only 45$\degree$ angles were allowed which led to a totally new transistor without known characteristics. A pixel based on this new transistor was detailed and tested for various sizes and processes. Simulation results indicated a small benefit for the new structure in term of attenuation, Input Referred Noise and SNR/pH. This suggests that it is preferable to use an enclosed gate transistor.

Since the results obtained through simulations have to be confirmed by experimentation, a complete system with a pH-sensing array and a characterization array is presented. This system includes a digital control block with a SPI interface to perform measurements on a 8x8 pixel array. The readout circuit is based on a minimalist structure to only evaluate the impact of the architecture on the sensitivity. Lastly, the pixel area was reduced to its minimum to obtain a compact organization. For its part, by presenting various hexagonal and standard transistors for different sizes, the characterization array would be able to confirm the model presented. Finally, the whole system was extensively tested to insure its correct operation. A prototype was realized %by, to, for ??% an included in the tape-out of July 2015.

\section{Future work}
The work achieved during this Master's thesis will be tested using the on-chip system created and available in October. In this situation future work involves to test and characterize the hexagonal transistor to validate the results presented in this thesis. Consequently, a regular hexagonal structure, with 60$\degree$ angles, could be implemented this time without adaptations to the process uses. These regular structures are more common and the properties are guaranteed whereas the structure presented is this work is completely ``exotic''.

Moreover, due to the broad scope of pH-sensing microarray there is a wide range of possible future developments that can be considered in extension to what was presented here. First and foremost it would be important to develop a more standardized readout circuit with compensation.
