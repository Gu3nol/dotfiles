This is a great opportunity.% I am also very grateful and have been given the opportunity to be involve for the tape-out of July 2015. This was the first time that I produced a chip. Being involved in such process was a rewarding experience.

I am also very grateful to the people who took part in the tape-out with me and gave me advice and support; Dora, Ermis, Nicholas and Nicolas. At the end there was a lot of pressure to get the chip done but we managed to do something great. A special thank to Nicolas for helping me when I was lost in my simulation and design. His friendship and motivation %encouraged me to do my best. %has kept me continually to do my best.
